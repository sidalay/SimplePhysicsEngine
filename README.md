# SimplePhysicsEngine

Attempting to simulate simple physics properties using C++ and raylib for graphics

Features: <br/>
``` 
[x] Gravity <br/>
[ ] Collision <br/>
[ ] Multiple object shapes 
   - Square
   - Circle
   - Triangle(?)
```

`Current Status:`
   - Barebones form of gravity has been implemented
   - Mass needs to be accounted for
   - Work on implementing linear interpolation to do various calculations
